Our review article on [Sudden Stratospheric Warmings](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/baldwin_etal-RG-2021.pdf), led by Mark Baldwin and Blanca Ayarzuguena, was just accepted for publication in Reviews in Geophysics.  We've learned a great deal about "explosionartigen Stratosph&auml;renerw&auml;rmungen" since they were first discovered by Prof. Dr. Scherhag almost 70 years ago! 

I continue to struggle with the kids at home, and failed to report that two papers have come out in print over the last months: [Numerical impacts on tracer transport: A proposed intercomparison test of Atmospheric General Circulation Models](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/gupta_gerber_lauritzen-QJ-2020.pdf) and 
[Downward migration of the zonal-mean circulation in the tropical atmosphere](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/dallasanta_gerber-GRL-2020.pdf).

Teaching a new class (and trying to make it work online) while the kids school from home has been a challenge. With the end of the semester now in sight, it's a matter of surviving the next month and regrouping in the new year.  Three papers are in the works ... stay tuned!
