Why do some Sudden Stratospheric Warmings appear to influence the troposphere, shifting the jet stream equatorward over the next 2-3 months, while others don't? Much of the issue is tropospheric variability, which can overwhelm the influence of the stratosphere. However, our recent study, [The Downward Influence of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings: Association with Tropospheric Precursors](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0053.1) shows that there are regional patterns that can help us predict whether a Sudden Warming is more likely to have an influence on the troposphere! 

The study was led by [Ian White](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_White13) at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and published in the [Journal of Climate](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0053.1).
