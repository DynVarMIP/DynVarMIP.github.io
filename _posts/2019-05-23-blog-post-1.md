Just submitted to [JAMES](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19422466): our [commentary](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/gerber_dallasanta_gupta-JAMES-revised.pdf) on a [nice paper by Zhihong Tan, Orli Lachmy, and Tiffany Shaw]( https://doi.org/10.1029/2018MS001492) that recently appeared in the same journal.  We make the case that *models of simpler atmospheres* -- which are distinct from *simple models of our atmosphere* -- can help us understand the circulation response of our atmosphere to global warming, and enable us to build better climate prediction models!
