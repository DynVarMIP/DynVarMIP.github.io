As my family and I cannibalize each other on our solitary descent into the abyss that is remote elementary education, intrepid collaborators will be hitting the virtual road to present at the [vEGU](https://www.egu21.eu/) this April!  Check out these presentations:

EGU21-336: Nonlinear Interaction between the Drivers of the Monsoon and Summertime Stationary Waves, presented by 
[Chaim Garfinkel](http://chaimgarfinkel.es.huji.ac.il/) in Session AS1.10 – The global monsoons in current, future and palaeoclimates and their role in extreme weather and climate events.

EGU21-1398: Machine Learning Emulation of Parameterized Gravity Wave Momentum Fluxes in an Atmospheric Global Climate Model, presented by [Zac Espinosa](https://eddy.stanford.edu/people) in Session AS1.14 – Internal Gravity Waves.

EGU21-16323: Forecasting rare stratospheric transitions using short simulations, presented by [Justin Finkel](https://cam.uchicago.edu/people/profile/justin-finkel/) in Session NP2.1 – Nonlinear Multiscale and Stochastic Dynamics of the Earth System.
