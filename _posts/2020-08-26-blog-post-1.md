A number of postdoctoral positions are available through a project
funded by NSF’s
[Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Inquiry (CSSI)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505505)
program.  <b>This highly collaborative project between four institutions
will develop data-driven parameterizations of atmospheric gravity
waves and explore their impact on climate variability and change.</b>  The
project will involve novel balloon-based observations, high-resolution
atmospheric model simulations, machine learning, and atmospheric
modeling. 

Candidates should have a Ph.D. in atmospheric science, applied mathematics, or a related
field at the time of appointment. The successful candidates will have
demonstrated the ability to carry out creative, innovative,
independent research, and to publish in the peer-reviewed
literature. The initial appointment is expected to be for one year,
with the possibility of renewal for subsequent years depending on
performance. Positions are available at the following institutes.
Please contact the PIs directly to apply, letting us know your
preference if you apply to multiple institutes. Please use the subject
line "postdoc application" in your email, and include a detailed CV
and a list of references in your application. 

* [New York University (Edwin Gerber)](https://edwinpgerber.github.io): focus on machine learning and atmospheric modeling
* [Rice University (Pedram Hassanzadeh).](http://pedram.rice.edu/): focus on machine learning and model development
* [Stanford University (Aditi Sheshadri)](https://eddy.stanford.edu/): focus on analysis of high resolution observations and idealized modeling

Applications received by October 1 will be guaranteed full
consideration, but we will continue to accept applications until all
positions are filled.   The start date may be negotiable, particularly
in light of the evolving COVID-19 situation. 

NWRA, NYU, Rice University, and Stanford University are equal
opportunity employers and are committed to increasing the diversity of
their staff. They welcome applications from women, members of minority
groups, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities, as well
as from others who would bring additional dimensions to the
university’s research, teaching and clinical missions.
