Please come to our workshop on the [Atmospheric Circulation in a Changing Climate](https://www.sparc-climate.org/meetings/workshop-on-atmospheric-circulation-in-a-changing-climate/). <br/><br/><b>22-25 October 2019, Madrid</b><br/><br/>
A joint [DynVarMIP](http://www.sparcdynvar.org/), [SPARC](https://www.sparc-climate.org/) [DynVar](https://www.sparc-climate.org/activities/dynamical-variability/), and [SNAP](https://www.sparc-climate.org/activities/assessing-predictability/) meeting, hosted by [Universidad Complutense Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/), [Instituto de Geociencias](http://www.igeo.ucm-csic.es/en/). A substantial amount of travel support is available for Early Career Scientists and participants from underrepresented nations!

Scientific Program
* A mechanistic understanding of atmospheric circulation trends
* The role of atmospheric dynamics in climate model biases
* Atmospheric heat and momentum budgets in a changing climate
* Stratosphere-troposphere coupling and tropospheric predictability

Abstract + Travel Support Deadline: â€‹30 June 2019
