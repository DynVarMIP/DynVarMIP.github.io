Our manuscript for Reviews of Geophysics,  [Model hierarchies for understanding atmospheric circulation](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/maher_etal-RG-2019.pdf), was just accepted!   [Way to go Penny!](http://www.penelopemaher.com/)  In particular, I like our new figure illustrating the web of models around state-of-the-art Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs).  These hierarchies of simpler models enables us to understand and improve our weather and climate prediction systems.
