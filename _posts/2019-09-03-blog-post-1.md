Our commentary for the [Journal of Advances in Modeling  Earth Systems](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19422466), "[Imagining Simpler Worlds to Understand the Complexity of our Own](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/gerber_dallasanta_gupta-JAMES-in_press.pdf)", was just accepted for publication.  It follows on a [nice paper by Zhihong Tan, Orli Lachmy, and Tiffany Shaw]( https://doi.org/10.1029/2018MS001492) that recently appeared in the same journal.

We make the case that *models of simpler atmospheres* -- which are distinct from *simple models of our atmosphere* -- can help us understand the circulation response of our atmosphere to global warming, and enable us to build better climate prediction models!
