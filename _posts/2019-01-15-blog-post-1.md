A scientist waxing lyrically upon the virtue of "model hierarchies" is about as hard to find as a politician paying homage to middle class values.  But what exactly do we mean by a hierarchy of models? And how have they actually advanced science?

In our review submitted to Reviews of Geophysics,  [Model hierarchies for understanding atmospheric circulation](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/maher_etal-RG-revised.pdf), an  effort led by [Penny Maher](http://www.penelopemaher.com/), we do our best to answer these questions ... and more!
