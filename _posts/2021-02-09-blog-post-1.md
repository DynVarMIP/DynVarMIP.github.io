The newly minted [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) has organized a virtual [conference on climate change from 1-5 March, 2021](https://www.imsi.institute/confronting-climate-change-2/).  Speakers including experts in applied mathematics and climate research -- and both, including my colleague [Laure Zanna](https://laurezanna.github.io/)!  It's my understanding that the meeting is free to atttend, but that you [must register in advance](https://www.imsi.institute/confronting-climate-change-2/).
