> Climate - Dynamics - Change

The CDC group at the NYU (not to be confused with the Center for Disease Control!) investigates the role of circulation and dynamics in a changing climate.  We focus on a range of scales (from km sized gravity waves to global storm tracks) and methods. The unifying theme is a desire to understand the natural variability of our atmosphere and how it responds to external forcing.  Understanding the atmospheric circulation is essential for narrowing uncertainty in regional climate change.  When it comes to precipitation change over land, and hence water security, the answer my friend, is blowin' in the wind.  


### Postdoctoral Research Scientists

* [Madeleine Youngs](http://myoungs.scripts.mit.edu/myoungs/) is a NOAA Global and Climate Change fellow. She joined the group in August 2020 after completing her PhD at MIT with [Glenn Flierl](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/grflierl).  Her research focuses on storm tracks in the oceans and atmosphere, bringing novel strategies from dynamical systems to bear on this classic problem.

* [Ofer Shamir](https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=RW8r8hoAAAAJ&hl=en) is also joining the group this summer.  He completed his PhD with [Nathan Paldor](https://en.earth.huji.ac.il/people/nathan-paldor) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  He brings a background in atmospheric dynamics and modeling to the [DataWave](https://datawaveproject.github.io/) gravity wave parameterization project.

### Graduate Students

## Former Members

### Postdoctoral Research Scientists

* [Martin Jucker](https://www.martinjucker.com/) (2014-2016) developed a [Model of an idealized Moist Atmosphere (MiMA)](http://mjucker.github.io/MiMA/) while at NYU.  He's now a Lecturer in Climate Dynamics and the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).

* [Changhyun Yoo](http://home.ewha.ac.kr/cyoo/) (2011-2014) investigated teleconnections between the tropical oceans and Antarctica.  He's now a professor at [Ewha Womans University](http://www.ewha.ac.kr/mbs/ewhaen/index.jsp), Korea.

### Doctoral Students

* [Aman Gupta](https://cims.nyu.edu/~agupta/) (PhD, 2020) explored the impact of model numerics on the transport in atmospheric models.  His thesis showed that [there remain significant differences in stratosphere-troposphere coupling and tracer transport between the behavior of state-of-the-art dynamical cores](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/gupta_gerber_lauritzen-QJ-2020.pdf).  Aman traveled a bit farther afield for his postdoc, joining [Thomas Birner's](https://www.meteo.physik.uni-muenchen.de/~Thomas.Birner/) group at [LMU Munich](http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html)!

* [Kevin DallaSanta](https://cims.nyu.edu/~dalla/) (PhD, 2019) investigated the large scale circulation of the atmosphere.  First, he investigated the [tropospheric circulation response to volcanic eruptions, using a hierarchy of models to probe the mechanism](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/files/dallasanta_gerber_toohey-JC-2019.pdf).  Second, he explored zonally coherent variability in the tropical atmosphere, discovering downward propagating anomalies on subseasonal time scales. He's now a Postdoctoral Fellow at [NASA GISS](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/), just a few miles uptown!

* [Naftali Cohen](https://naftalic.github.io/bio/) (PhD, 2014) investigated the overturning circulation of the stratosphere and interactions between the resolved circulation and parameterized gravity waves in atmospheric models.  He's since shifted in data science and is working in industry (JP Morgan Chase, last time I checked!)

* [Xichen Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xichen_Li2) (PhD, 2014) focused on teleconnections between the the tropical oceans and the circulation around Antarctica, with a particular focus on links between the tropical Atlantic and Admunsen Sea.  He's now at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing.
