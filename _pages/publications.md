## Disclaimer:
Links to these papers are provided for your personal, non-commercial use. Research journals require a source of revenue to offset the true costs of publishing and archiving scientific research. The official record is always the paper available from their controlled webpages.

At the same time, this research was publicly funded, reviewed, and edited by volunteer scientist (who were in large part supported through public funding). The funding agencies, academic community, and publishing companies are currently seeking out a better solution, where all publicly supported research is always available to the public, but the journals still have a reasonable source of revenue.
