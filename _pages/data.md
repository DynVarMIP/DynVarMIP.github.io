The rationale and the diagnostics proposed by DynVarMIP are presented in [Gerber and Manzini (2016)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3413/2016/).

## Models

The DynVarMIP collected enhanced diagnostics from Coupled Global Atmosphere, Ocean and Sea ice Models (e.g., climate models or AOGCMs) participating in the CMIP6, [listed here](https://dynvarmip.github.io/participants/).   We've focused on models appropriate for capturing the stratosphere-troposphere system, i.e., which provide high vertical resolution and position the model top above the stratopause.

## Experiments

DynVarMIP targets the [DECK](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) experiments (AMIP, Pre-industrial control, abrupt4xCO2 and 1pctCO2), the CMIP6 historical, the high emission [ScenarioMIP](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/CMIP6/ScenarioMIP/) SSP8.5 experiments, and three [Cloud Feedback Model Inctercomparison Project (CFMIP)](https://www.cfmip.org/) experiments: amip-4xCO2, amipt-future4K, and amip-p4K.  Data was also requested for select experiments within [VolMIP](http://www.volmip.org/), [AerChemMIP](https://wiki.met.no/aerocom/aerchemmip/start), and [HiResMIP](https://hrcm.ceda.ac.uk/research/cmip6-highresmip/), where there is overlap in scientific interest. 

## Diagnostics

Dynvar has established a set of diagnostics  [(Gerber and Manzini, 2016)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3413/2016/) to enable a mechanistic approach to confront model biases and understand the underlying causes behind circulation changes.


## Data Availability

DynVarMIP data are available as part of the CMIP6 dataset via the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) data portals](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/). The [information here list data that is currently available, based on an analysis of the ESGF in May 2021](https://dynvarmip.github.io/files/DynVarMIP-Data-Availability-May2021.pdf).
