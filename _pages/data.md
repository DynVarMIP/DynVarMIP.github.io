The rationale and the diagnostics proposed by DynVarMIP are presented in [Gerber and Manzini (2016)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3413/2016/).

## Models

The DynVarMIP collected enhanced diagnostics from Coupled Global Atmosphere, Ocean and Sea ice Models (e.g., climate models or AOGCMs) participating in the CMIP6, [listed here](https://dynvarmip.github.io/participants/).   We've focused on models appropriate for capturing the stratosphere-troposphere system, i.e., which provide high vertical resolution and position the model top above the stratopause.

## Experiments

DynVarMIP targets the [DECK](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) experiments (AMIP, Pre-industrial control, abrupt4xCO2 and 1pctCO2), the CMIP6 historical and the ScenarioMIP RCP8.5 experiments, as well as selected experiments within VolMIP, AeroChemMIP, and HiResMIP, where there is natural overlap in scientific interest. 

## Diagnostics

Dynvar has established a set of diagnostics  [(Gerber and Manzini, 2016)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3413/2016/) to enable a mechanistic approach to confront model biases and understand the underlying causes behind circulation changes.

Modelling centers are providing the DynVarMIP diagnostics, via CMIP6.  This portion of the site is under construction, and we hope to provide more information soon.
