> Global warming is real. We are causing it.  We can stop it.

As scientist, I am hesitant to engage in the politics of climate change.  In an ideal world, we should provide our expertise on the state of our planet, and what is likely to happen to it depending on the choices we make today and in the future.  The question of how to respond to this information is an ethical and political matter.  But the facts about what is happening -- and whether we can do something about it -- are not a matter of opinion.

There is overwhelming scientific evidence that people are warming the Earth beyond natural variability. This position is held by virtually all climate scientists, NASA, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the worldâ€™s most authoritative organization on climate change).

The question today is no longer if man-made climate change is happening, but how its challenges can be solved by human ingenuity. We must rapidly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in order to minimize the significant risks of climate change, such as more extreme heat waves, prolonged droughts and severe floods. Our actions will have lasting impacts on generations to come.

The above is the Tyndall Petition. Check out [skepticalscience.com](https://www.skepticalscience.com/) and [realclimate.org](http://www.realclimate.org/) to learn more about climate change and the effort to prevent it. We can stop global warming and maintain a vibrant, growing economy. The only thing we lack today is the will.
