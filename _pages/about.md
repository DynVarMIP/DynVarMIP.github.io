The Dynamics and Variability Model Intercomparison Project (DynVarMIP) is an endorsed participant in the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) of the [World Climate Research Program (WCRP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/).

DynVarMIP emerged from the Stratosphere-Troposphere Process and their Role in Climate Project ([SPARC](https://www.sparc-climate.org/)) [DynVar activity](https://www.sparc-climate.org/activities/dynamical-variability/) on the modelling of the dynamics and variability of the stratosphere-troposphere system. SPARC is a core project of WCRP.

Rather than proposing new experiments, the DynVarMIP provides additional model output from existing CMIP6 experiments. This additional output is critical for understanding the role of atmospheric dynamics in past, present and future climate.
