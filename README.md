# Website Repo for DataWave Project
Put together by Marshall Borrus

## Website creation

The site was originally compiled locally on my computer (with Hugo), and was uploaded to Github as files were updated. The website is recompiled at Datawaveproject.github.io every time a file is pushed to the repisitory thanks to some handy internet guides which use a public workflow file to run Hugo online. 

## Website editing

To edit files on the website, you can clone the repository to your local drive, or edit the files using the online editing interface. Email mborrus@stanford.edu for editing permisions.
