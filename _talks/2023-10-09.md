This five-day workshop on the [role of atmospheric dynamics in climate and extremes](https://www.aparc-climate.org/meetings/the-role-of-atmospheric-dynamics-for-climate-and-extremes/) was held at the Meteorological Institute at LMU-Munich.  The scientific program focussed on:

* Links of atmospheric circulation to weather and climate on subseasonal to centennial timescales

* The role of stratosphere-troposphere coupling in predictability of tropospheric climate and surface weather extremes

* The influence of climate model biases on uncertainty in predictions and projections

* Emerging dynamical constraints to understand and reduce projection uncertainties

* Mechanistic understanding of dynamic coupling, teleconnections, and trends
