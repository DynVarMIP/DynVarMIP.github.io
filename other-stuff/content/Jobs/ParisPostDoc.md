<p> A 2-year post doctoral position is opening at the “Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique” to work on the parameterization of atmospheric gravity waves in the IPSL Climate model. The candidate will develop off-line versions of the operational subgrid scale parameterizations of gravity waves that are related to mountains (Lott and Miller 1997), convection (Lott and Guez 2013) and fronts (de la Camara and Lott 2016) and guide them with analysis field from  ECMWF.

The candidate will then vary the parameters of the schemes to give the best fit against balloon observations. Then, the IPSL model will be launched over long periods (climate), and the impact of the updated scheme on various key climate modes will be tested. The candidate will then test if the changes made in the parameterization impact the model climate in climate change scenarios.

Depending on the his own skill and desire, the candidate could instead  conduct research to improve our understanding of the mountain drag forces.  The contribution of the gravity waves to that force, and in the presence of atmospheric boundary layers and trapped lee waves will be ascertain.  We seek to develop parameterizations that handle orographic boundary layer drag and gravity wave drag on the same basis, distinguishing the two according to the low level flow stability.  The candidate  will develop theory and test impacts in the IPSL Climate  model again, may be in the ECMWF model.

The candidate will actively interact with an international consortium (USA, UK, Germany, France).
### Employment conditions
The position opens for two years, salaries according to the local french standards (around 2500E net/month but this depends on experience and includes social insurances). This call stays  opened after its initial deadline Feb, 20, 2021. Starting date: as soon as possible.

### Qualifications:
PHD in atmospheric sciences, geophysical fluid dyamics, climate dynamics or related fields.
Publication(s) in peer-reviewed international journals
Experience in modeling, programming, data management.

### Document requested:
Applicants should send via e-mail to [François Lott]({{< ref "/Team/" >}}):
1. a statement of research experience, qualification and interest
2. a complete CV including a list of publications
3. the name of at least two scientists who would agree to send a letter of recommendation.
