This is my first ever _virtual_ colloquium visit.  From the comforts of my own office, I'll present my talk over the internet, coupled with a day of virtual meetings with students, postdocs, and faculty.  The goal is to reduce our CO2 footprint -- something our field should mindful of more than any other --  but it will also help reduce the "family footprint", i.e. the impact on spouses left to deal with kids who tend to get sick this time of year.  Ugh.  Only catch is that the seminar is 3:30 pm on a Friday, Pacific time!
