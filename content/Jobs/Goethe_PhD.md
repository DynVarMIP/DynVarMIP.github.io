<p>A 3-year PhD student is opening in the research group <i>Theory of Atmospheric Dynamics and Climate</i> at the Institute of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences of the <a href="https://frankfurt.de/english/about-frankfurt">Goethe University</a> to be filled as soon as possible. The field of research shall be the theory of the nonlinear dynamics of atmospheric gravity waves and their efficient representation in models. The focus will be on mountain waves in the advanced parameterization framework MS-GWaM in the weather-forecast and climate code UA-ICON.</p>

The candidate will use idealized wave-resolving simulations of deep-atmosphere finite-volume code for studying the process of gravity-wave generation by flow over mountains, and use machine learning (ML) for training a corresponding source formulation in MS-GWaM. Contributions to corresponding theoretical work would be welcome. Links to research in the group using UA-ICON are intended. The whole will be embedded in the collaborative project DataWave (https://datawaveproject.github.io/) with international partners including Stanford University, New York University, Rice University, the UK Met Office, the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, and the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, involving novel balloon-based observations, model simulations, theoretical work, and ML.

Information on the research group can be found at http://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/45681958/Theory-of-Atmospheric-Dynamics-and-Climate. Its focus is on scale interactions in atmospheric dynamics, applied e.g. to large-scale low-frequency variability or gravity-wave dynamics. Middle-atmosphere dynamics is another field of work. Methods employed are e.g. multi-scale asymptotics, stochastics, and numerical simulations. Inquiries should be addressed to Prof. Dr. Ulrich Achatz (achatz@iau.uni-frankfurt.de).

### Terms:
PhD Student (E13 TV-GU/2) to be filled as soon as possible.
The initial appointment will be for three years, with the possibility for renewals for subsequent years. Depending on success, stepwise salary increases up to 75% TV-GU are intended.

### Qualifications:
Diploma/Master's degree in meteorology, physics, applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, astronomy, or a related field.
Strong background in theory and/or modeling.

### Document requested:
Applicants should send via e-mail to [Ulrich Achatz]({{< ref "/Team/" >}}):
1. a statement of research experience, qualification and interest
2. a complete CV
3. at least two contacts who would agree to send a letter of recommendation.

Information should be submitted by 30.4.21. Applications will be considered beyond this date until the post has been filled.
