Trends in summer tropopause Rossby wave breaking (RWB) are examined using meteorological reanalyses and model integrations. The reanalyses for the last 30 years show large increases in RWB on the equatorward side of the tropospheric jet and weak decreases on the poleward side. Comparable changes in RWB are found in general circulation model integrations whose stratospheric ozone differs between 1960 and 2000 levels, but not in integrations that differ only in their greenhouse gas concentrations and sea‚Äêsurface temperatures. These results indicate that the formation of the ozone hole has led to changes in RWB frequency during southern summer.
