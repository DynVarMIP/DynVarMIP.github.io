## Abstract
There is great uncertainty in the atmospheric circulation response to future Arctic sea ice loss, with some models predicting a shift towards the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), while others predicting a more neutral NAO response. We investigate the potential role of systematic model biases in the spread of these responses by modifying the unperturbed (or 'control') climate (hereafter referred to as the 'basic state') of the Canadian Earth system model version 5 (CanESM5) in sea ice loss experiments based on the protocol of the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project. We show that the presence or absence of the stratospheric pathway in response to sea ice loss depends on the basic state, and that only the CanESM5 version that shows a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex features a strong negative NAO response. We propose a mechanism that explains this dependency, with a key role played by the vertical structure of the winds in the region between the subtropical jet and the stratospheric polar vortex ('the neck region winds'), which determines the extent to which anomalous planetary wave activity in response to sea ice loss propagates away from the polar vortex. Our results suggest that differences in the models' basic states could significantly contribute to model spread in the simulated atmospheric circulation response to sea ice loss, which may inform efforts to narrow the uncertainties regarding the impact of diminishing sea ice on mid-latitude climate.
